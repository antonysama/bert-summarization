# "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException "
# It means that a class is being referenced but not found. 
# It is usually caused by they referenced class not being at the referenced location, or on the same layer of the project file.
# Solved by adding "/home/antony/environments/n/" into this:
  export CLASSPATH=/home/antony/environments/n/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05/stanford-corenlp-3.9.2.jar

# "Seq2Seq model decode error problem "Not found: Tensor name..."
# Solved by restoring directory path with original checkpoints:

#from config run utils gives import error no application named utils
#Bring the .py to root and run it. As import config  was looking for the utils folder below root, if 
one modifies import config and keep it inside the  folder it should work.
