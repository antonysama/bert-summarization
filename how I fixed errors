# "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException "
# It means that a class is being referenced but not found. 
# It is usually caused by they referenced class not being at the referenced location, or on the same layer of the project file.
# Solved by adding "/home/antony/environments/n/" into this:
  export CLASSPATH=/home/antony/environments/n/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05/stanford-corenlp-3.9.2.jar
